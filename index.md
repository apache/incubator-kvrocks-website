## Apache Kvrocks (Incubating)

Apache Kvrocks (Incubating) is a distributed key value NoSQL database that uses RocksDB as storage engine and is compatible with Redis protocol. Kvrocks intends to decrease the cost of memory and increase the capacity while compared to Redis.

It has the following key features:

* Redis protocol, user can use redis client to visit the kvrocks
* Namespace, similar to redis db but use token per namespace
* Replication, async replication using binlog like MySQL
* High Available, supports redis sentinel to failover when master or slave was failed
* Cluster mode, centralized management but compatible with Redis cluster client access
